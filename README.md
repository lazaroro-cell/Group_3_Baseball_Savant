![](images/Baseball_2.jpg)

## Progress on the 8 Major Tasks

1) We selected Option 1 — Baseball Savant MLB performance indicators.  

2) Repository created.Team will be collaborating using GitHub respository (Commit → Pull → Push workflow is currently used)

3) Data downloaded from baseballsavant.mlb.com (We are currently searching for some other data sources to merge with the baseball savant data)

4) We will use a combination of data analysis languages and software (R, Python & Tableau). Visualization will include: Scatter Plots for relationships between variables, Line Plots to show performance trends over years, Boxplots to visualize distributions of key metrics & Histograms for frequency distributions of variables.

5) We will compute:
On-Base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), Isolated power, Batting avg. & Exit Velocity

6) This README.md is Checkpoint 1 deliverable.

7) The format of the recorded video will be discussed in later checkpoints (The video should show results with narration).

8) A separate markdown report will be developed in /report/analytical_story.md.
