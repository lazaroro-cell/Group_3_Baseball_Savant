# Group #3 - Checkpoint 2

![](images/Baseball_1.jpg)
## 1. Introduction
Our team explores **MLB batting performance indicators** using data from Baseball Savant.  
**Decision-maker / Context:** Baseball analysts and coaches interested in understanding player performance stats.
**Research Question:** Which batting metrics are most predictive of overall offensive value, and how players performance over time indicate their success?  
**Impact:** Insights could guide player evaluation, team decisions, and strategy planning.

## 2. Data Summary
**Primary Dataset:** `Baseball_Savant.csv`  
- Columns include: player info, batting stats, KPIs (OBP, SLG, OPS, ISO, BABIP, RBI/PA, xBA, xSLG, exit velocity)  
- Data characteristics: Mixed continuous metrics, percentages, and categorical identifiers (player, year)  
- Summary statistics (a summary table to be shown here:

## 3. Data Analytics (will include all our analysis / visualizations)
**KPIs Computed:**
- OBP, SLG, OPS, ISO, BABIP, RBI/PA, Exit Velocity, xBA, xSLG, wOBA, xwOBA

**Visualizations (placeholders for Python-generated / Tableau plots):**
- Scatter Plots:  
  - BA vs OBP  
  - SLG vs Exit Velocity  
- Line Plots: Year-over-year performance  
- Boxplots: Distribution of key metrics  
- Histograms: Exit Velocity, Plate Appearances

**Initial Insights (to be updated as analysis progresses):**
- Patterns in player performance over multiple seasons  
- Differences in metrics between top performers  

---

## 4. Conclusion
**Analytical Summary:**  
- The methodology combines KPI computation and visualization in Python.  
- Early trends suggest certain metrics (*****) may be more predictive of overall players performance.  
- Limitations: Data limited to batting stats (example on limitations); does not include defensive or situational context.
- Future Work: Incorporate additional datasets, refine predictive metrics, deeper trend analysis.

## 5. Policy Recommendation
**Hypothetical Decision:**  
- Team management deciding which players to prioritize in contracts or lineups.

**Data-driven Recommendation:**  
- Focus on players with higher OPS and ISO, especially if consistent over multiple seasons.  
- Consider first-order effect: Improved team scoring potential.  
- Second-order effect: Salary budgeting, lineup adjustments, player development.  

**Benefits:**  
- Quantitative, objective evaluation of offensive potential  
**Risks:**  
- May overlook situational or defensive contributions  
- Requires ongoing monitoring of updated metrics

## Next Steps for Checkpoint 2

1. Complete KPI calculations in Python and update tables.  
2. Generate initial visualizations and save them in `images/`.  
3. Update README.md with insights from analysis.  
4. Commit and push updates to `Group_3_Checkpoint_2.0` branch regularly.  
5. Regularly amend the final report in README.md.


## Team Collaboration Notes

Challenges:

- Learning Git workflow and branch management
- Collaborating in code writing

Victories:

- Created a common repo
- Created project outline
- Assigned roles
- Learning GitHub Desktop workflow (branch management, pushing/pulling)
- Agreed on main indicators & KPIs to analyze

## The next section will be deleted from our final report.

## Progress on the 8 Major Tasks

1) We selected Option 1 — Baseball Savant MLB performance indicators.  

2) Repository created.Team are collaborating on GitHub (Commit → Pull → Push workflow is currently used)

3) Data downloaded from baseballsavant.mlb.com

4) Python & Tableau are currently used for analysis and visualizations: Scatter Plots for relationships between variables, Line Plots to show performance trends over years, Boxplots to visualize distributions of key metrics & Histograms for frequency distributions of variables.

5) The team is working on KPIs and forecast:
On-Base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), Isolated power, Batting avg. & Exit Velocity

6) This README.md is Checkpoint 2 deliverable.

7) The recorded video will show results with narration.

8) The final report will be displayed in the README.md file on the repo landing page.
