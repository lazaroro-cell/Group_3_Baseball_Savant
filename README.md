![](images/Baseball_3.jpg)

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes MLB offensive performance indicators from 2021–2025 and projects team and player level trends through 2028. Using data from **Baseball Savant**, we identified key metrics — OPS, ISO, OBP, SLG, and exit velocity — that strongly influence offensive success. The report targets new MLB managers entering the field.

Data-driven insights help prioritize acquisitions, lineup decisions, and development focus for immediate and long-term impact.

- **Players:** Top performers show consistent OPS and ISO trends; exit velocity correlates moderately with power metrics. Projections highlight potential breakout players and those likely to sustain high performance.

- **Teams:** Linear regression projections of Win%, SLG, OBP, RBI, ISO, and OPS suggest which teams may improve or decline over the next three seasons, helping anticipate competitive dynamics.

**Recommendations:**

- Focus on players with consistently high OPS and ISO to strengthen your lineup.

- Monitor emerging talents who show upward trends in exit velocity and isolated power.

- At the team level, invest in strategies that improve OBP and SLG to maximize run production.

## 1. Introduction

Our team analyzes **MLB batting performance indicators** using data from Baseball Savant covering the period from 2021–2025. This analysis focuses on metrics that are predictive of team and player success, such as: EV, OPS, ISO, OBP, and SLG.

**Decision-maker:**

- This report is designed for a young MLB manager entering the field, who needs actionable insights to make decisions on lineups, player acquisitions, and offensive strategy.

**Research Question:**

- Which batting metrics and team-level KPIs are most predictive of future offensive performance, and how can these insights guide managerial decisions for the next three seasons (2026–2028)?

**Impact:**

- By understanding trends and projections, the new MLB manager can identify key performers, prioritize acquisitions, optimize lineups, and plan for sustainable team success.

## 4. Conclusion

Our analysis combined historical MLB player and team level statistics with regression-based projections to estimate future offensive performance for 2026–2028. By examining KPIs such as SLG, OBP, OPS, ISO, RBI, Batting Average, and Exit Velocity, we generated insights into which metrics are most indicative of future success.

**Key Findings:**

- OPS and ISO consistently emerge as the strongest indicators of future offensive performance at both the team and player levels. Teams and players maintaining strong OPS trends also show positive projections in Win%, RBI, and SLG.

- Exit Velocity has moderate correlation with power metrics (ISO ≈ 0.65, SLG ≈ 0.62), but does not strongly correlate with most KPIs. This means EV is useful, but not a primary predictor in our dataset.

**Team Projections (2026–2028):**

- Projected Win%, SLG, OBP, ISO, and OPS show identifiable upward/downward trends, helping estimate which teams may strengthen or decline offensively.

**Player Projections (2026–2028):**

- Top hitters show differentiated paths in SLG, OPS, ISO, AVG, OBP, and Exit Velocity, helping identify consistent elite hitters versus potential breakout performers.

**Heatmaps and Scatter Plots:**

- Visualizations confirm metric relationships and validate the linear regression models used for projections.
Scatter plots visually confirm the moderate relationships between EV and power statistics.

**Limitations:**

- The model only uses batting statistics; defensive and situational factors are not included.

- Projections are based on linear regression, which may not capture sudden changes (injuries, role changes, coaching changes, etc.).

- Extreme outliers were trimmed (5th–95th percentile) to stabilize results.

**Future Work:**

- Add park effects, defensive WAR, sprint speed, pitch-level statcast features, injury history, and multivariate models.

- Use machine learning methods for improved forecasting accuracy.

## 5. Policy Recommendation

**Hypothetical Decision:**

- Prioritize player acquisitions, lineup optimization, trade evaluation, and contract negotiations based on projected offensive outputs.

**Data-driven Recommendation:**

- Focus on players and teams with consistently high OPS, ISO, and OBP. Consider potential breakout performers in mid-tier metrics.

**Benefits:**

- Quantitative and objective evaluation of offensive potential.

**Risks:**

- The recommendations ignore defensive and baserunning contributions and external variables such as player health or mid-season trades. Continuous monitoring and model updates are essential.
