![Figure 1](images/Baseball_1.jpg)

## Progress on the 8 Major Tasks

1) We selected Option 1 — Baseball Savant MLB performance indicators.  

2) Repository created.Team will be collaborating using GitHub respository (Commit → Pull → Push workflow is currently used)

3) Data downloaded from baseballsavant.mlb.com (We are currently searching for some other data sources to merge with the baseball savant data)

4) We will use a combination of data analysis languages and softwares (R, Python & Tableau). Visualization will include: Scatter Plots for relationships between variables, Line Plots to show performance trends over years, Boxplots to visualize distributions of key metrics, Histograms for frequency distributions of variables.

5) We will compute:
On-Base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), Isolated power, Batting avg. & Exit Velocity

6) This README.md is Checkpoint 1 deliverable.

7) The format of the recorded video will be discussed in later checkpoints (The video should show results with narration).

8) A separate markdown report will be developed in /report/analytical_story.md.
